- High Stiffness
- Poor Toughness
- Expensive

### Weaves
[Weaves explained](https://www.carbon.ee/en/n/carbon-fiber-all-patterns-explained)
#### 1x1 Pattern:
- Not the strongest of weave but is solid
- Easiest to handle without making the fibers on the ends too messed up. 
- Other weaves fall part incredibly fast, but make up for this is some cool patterns and more strength in the direction of the weave. 
- Tightest weave.

#### 2x2 Twill:
- Is braid over-over-under-under. 
- This pattern is elastic and it is good for use with complex shapes because its weave is looser. 

#### 4x4 Twill
- 4X4 twill will bend around curves better than a 2X2 twill weave. 

#### 4 Harness-Satin
- Supposedly some of the stronger structural weaves. 
- 4HS= 4 over 1

#### 5 Harness-Satin
- Has more weaves per inch than a plain or twill weave (defined as “pics”). 
- Has a higher pic count and it will hold together bit better than a twill weave when handled carefully. 
- 5HS= 5 over 1  

#### 8 Harness-Satin
- Weave will fall apart in your hands if not handled well. 
- If you have very complex curves, an 8 Harness-Satin is the best choice. 
- 8HS= 8 over 1

#### Unidirectional
- Is used in applications where almost all of the forces exerted on the object come form one axis (up and down, left and right, front and rear). 

#### Triaxial Balanced
- The number of fiber directions from two to three, and changing the orientation of the fibers from orthogonal to 60 degrees
- increases the damage tolerance 
- improves energy absorption. 
- The weaving construction is ‘two over, two under’, alternating over and under the axial yarns.
- Applications are for composite reinforcement in aerospace, engineering, sports equipment and automotive racing.

#### Trixtial Patterns
- Triaxial weaving produces material which is structurally superior to many sorts of rectangular weaving. 
- Structural elements run in three directions
- More resistant to shearing forces 
- Doesn't easily crimp
- Good strain resistance
- Planar shear resistance
- Tear resistance
- Abrasion resistance 
- Bursting resistance. 
- Light weight; 
- Low material cost
- Isotropy
- Shear-resistant

#### 1K x 3K Plain Weave
- 3K warp and a 1K fill its loose weave is highly formable and wets out easily
- Used to add selective directional reinforcement without adding considerable weight

#### Labyrinth
- Lightest fabric
- Easiest to work with when conforming to curves


## Kevlar
- High Tensile strength to weight
- High Abrasion resistance
- Terrible compression values
- Damaged by UV


## Fiberglass
- Good strength to weight
- Cheap
- Tough
- Not stiff
