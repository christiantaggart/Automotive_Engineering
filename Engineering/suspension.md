## Four Link:
- Types of four-links: parallel & triangulated
- Purpose: hold the rear axle in its proper place under the vehicle, under hard acceleration or cornering.
- The bottom two links:
  - Mitigate linear axle movement (front to back)
- The Upper two links:
  - Mitigate axle rotation & keeps the pinion angle constant. 
### Triangulated four-link:
- Upper bars also keep the rear end centered under the car
  - Eliminates need for Panhard rod or Watt's link
  - Provides more clearance for exhaust, fuel tank, batteries
  - gives the rear suspension a clean, uncluttered look
  - The design provides for a low roll center and helps plant the car well through the corners


On the down side, a triangulated four-link has associated roll bind inherent in its geometry. Roll bind, which is the unintended, non-linear resistance to body roll, happens when side load is placed on the pivot points of all four links under hard cornering. Many factory suspensions, such as the '78-88 GM G-body (Chevy Monte Carlo and Malibu, Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix, and Olds Cutlass) and Fox-body Mustangs, suffer from severe roll bind. This can manifest itself as snap oversteer, or an unexpected transition from understeer to oversteer. The use of Heim joints or urethane bushings goes a long way toward rectifying this trait, and is far more obvious in OEM triangulated four-links than in aftermarket designs with non-deflecting spherical rod joints or urethane bushings.
