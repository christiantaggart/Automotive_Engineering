### Cosworth W201 History :
- Mercedes asked Cosworth to develop 320 bhp (239 kW) engine (Race spec)
  - This was known as project "WAA' by Cosworth
- Cars racing in (DTM) must be based on a Roadgoing model
  - Mercedes produced a 190 fitted with a detuned version of the Cosworth engine
  - Roadgoing model named 190E 2.3-16
    - Debuted at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 1983

#### Other Features on Cosworth Version:
- **LSD / TRACTION**
- All 2.3-16-valve 190 models are fitted (LSD) as standard.
- They were also available with Mercedes' ASD system which was standard equipment on the 2.5-16v.
  - The ASD is an electronically controlled, hydraulically locking differential which activates automatically when required.
  - The electronic control allows varied amounts of differential lock from the standard 15% right up to 100%.
    - It is not a traction control system however, and can only maximize traction rather than prevent wheel spin.
    - Activation of the ASD system is indicated by an illuminating amber triangle in the speedometer.
- **Suspension vs standard W201**
- Quicker dampers
- Larger anti-roll bars
- Harder bushings
- hydraulic Self-levelling suspension (SLS) on the rear.
  - This allows the rear ride height to remain constant even when the car is fully loaded.
