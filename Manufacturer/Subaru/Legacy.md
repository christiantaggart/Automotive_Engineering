- History
  - The (Japanese: Subaru EZ series) was introduced in 1999 in the Japanese market, in the Subaru Outback, and in 2000 in the United States market, also in the Outback.
  - It is a flat-six, 24-valve, quad-cam engine with an aluminium block and heads.
  - It is available in EZ30 and EZ36 variants.
    - Though the second iteration of the EZ30D used from 2003 to 2009 was heavily updated from the early EZ30D used from 2001 to 2003, Subaru continued to identify it as EZ30D.

  - All EZ-series engines use dual timing chains and feature coil-on-plug ignition.
- EZ30D:
- This version uses one exhaust port per head, a cable-actuated throttle, variable intake geometry, and a cast aluminium intake manifold.
  - It was only available with an automatic transmission.
